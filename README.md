# Sleep as Android parser

["Sleep as Android" by urbandroid](https://sleep.urbandroid.org/) lets you export your sleep data in an unorganized and chaotic csv table. This script converts it to readable json for easier use with other applications or visualisation utilities. 

The code is well documented and serves as documentation of the SaA export format. 

Use it with PHP like this:

`php parser.php <input-file> [output-file]`
